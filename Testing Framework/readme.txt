Dependencies
Make sure you have Node.js installed (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Set up on a localhost
- Navigate to project directory using command line
- enter "npm install" this will install all other dependencies
- enter "node server.js"
- a message "Server has started" should pop up
- go to http://localhost:8000/ to use the program

Set up on openstack

The process of setting up the program on openstack via webserver is as following:
    1. ask SCS to proxy the webserver to port 80 on the dev server instance
    2. change the parts of code that when inqurey files, it would instead inqurey them in directory "comp3008_28/"
    3. run the program locally on port 80

The program should run locally on the port 80, which is being proxy to the webserver. The apache webserver will then utilize the program that is running on port 80 to make it avaliable on the url:   https://comp3008-w20.scs.carleton.ca/comp3008_28/
